5.9.1 Flight mode optimization
Updates are as follows:
1. Decrease the forward tilt angle of the servo when switching the fixed wing from 60° to 80°.
Q_TILT_MAX=80 Tilt to this angle and wait for the airspeed to reach
2. When the fixed wing approaches the home 60 meters, it will automatically convert to multi-axis
RTL_RADIUS=60
3. Increase from 30 to 45, increase the speed of vertical conversion fixed wing
Q_TILT_RATE_DN=45 The speed of tilting down (15=15 degrees in 1 second)
4. Q_TRANS_DECEL=2.5 Deceleration rate, the glide distance from fixed wing to multi-axis (the smaller the value, the longer the glide)
5. AHRS_ORIENTATION =0 flight controller installation direction
6. Increase the maximum angle of the aileron axis from 60 to 70°
LIM_ROLL_CD=70 The maximum deflection angle of the ailerons in the stabilization mode




5.8.3 Fixed wing optimization
Updates are as follows:
7. Decrease the forward tilt angle of the servo when switching the fixed wing from 50° to 60°.
Q_TILT_MAX=60 Tilt to this angle and wait for the airspeed to reach
8. When the fixed wing is close to home 50 meters, it will automatically convert to multi-axis
RTL_RADIUS=50
9. The speed of multi-axis vertical descent can also be slower.
Q_LAND_SPEED=50 The second stage falling speed, 60=60 cm per second)
10. From 15 to 30, increase the speed of the vertical conversion fixed wing
Q_TILT_RATE_DN=30 The speed of tilting down (15=15 degrees in 1 second)
11. The OSD speed unit is changed to KM. Simplified OSD.


5.8 Optimized version of fixed wing mode
Updates are as follows:
12. Increase the maximum angle of the aileron axis
LIM_ROLL_CD=70 The maximum deflection angle of the ailerons in the stabilization mode
13. Increase the forward tilt angle of the steering gear when switching the fixed wing from 50° to 60°.
Q_TILT_MAX=60 Tilt to this angle and wait for the airspeed to reach
14. The multi-axis descending speed is increased (when it goes down diagonally, not vertically), because there is a speed and the wings are not easy to flip over, we adjust it faster to save time.
Q_WP_SPEED_DN=250
15. When the fixed wing is close to home 60 meters, it will automatically convert to multi-axis
RTL_RADIUS=60
16. The speed of multi-axis vertical descent can also be faster.
Q_LAND_SPEED=60 The second stage falling speed, 60=60 cm per second)




5.7 Enhanced Maneuverability in Fixed Wing Mode
Updates are as follows:
17. Increase the maximum angle of the aileron axis (45~65)
LIM_ROLL_CD=60 The maximum deflection angle of the ailerons in the stabilized mode, be careful of stalling.
18. Increase the maximum angle of the lift axis
LIM_PITCH_MAX=3500 Elevation angle 35° in auto stabilization mode
LIM_PITCH_MIN=-3000 Pitch angle 35° in auto stabilization mode
19.
20. Increase the forward tilt angle of the steering gear when switching the fixed wing from 40° to 50°.
Q_TILT_MAX=50 (tilt to this angle and wait for the airspeed to reach, 70=70 degrees)

21. Increase the multi-axis sailing speed, the default is only 5 meters per second (too slow), so we double the speed, so that when switching back to multi-axis, the speed will not be too fast and need to be braked (the altitude will change greatly), and also save time.
Q_WP_SPEED=800 (1000 cm = 10 meters per second, 1500 is still acceptable)
22. The speed of multi-axis descent is increased (when it goes down diagonally, not vertically), because there is a speed and the wings are not easy to turn over, we adjust it faster to save time.
Q_WP_SPEED_DN=200
23. When the fixed wing approaches the home 30 meters, it starts to automatically convert to multi-axis
RTL_RADIUS=30
24. The speed of multi-axis vertical descent can also be faster.
Q_LAND_SPEED=50
25. Q_LAND_FINAL_ALT=3 The height of the second stage landing is less than 3 meters
26. ALT_HOLD_RTL=8000 (fixed wing self-return height, 7000=7000 cm, is 70 meters, if -1 is the original height)
Q_RTL_ALT=30 (the altitude of the multi-axis return home, from this altitude it starts to descend)



5.7 Lock tail enhanced version
Updates are as follows:
1. Increase the tilting servo angle from 10° to 20°.
2. Increase heading gain, P : 0.55 ; I : 0.055 ; D : 0.05

After the update, a small amount of improvements were made to the problem that the course could not be locked in strong outdoor winds. However, the tail locking effect is tight enough, the dynamic response is slow, and the locking rate is low. No suitable improvement method has been found yet.
